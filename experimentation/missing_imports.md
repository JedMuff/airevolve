# Missing Imports in Experimentation Directory

This file documents the imports that were commented out during the cleanup process because the corresponding files/modules could not be found in the current codebase structure.

## Missing Files/Modules

### 1. Genotype Module
**File:** `slurm_cluster/main_evaluation.py:13`
```python
# from airevolve.genotypes.genotype3 import Orie3DSym, Orie3D  # Missing file
```
**Expected Location:** `airevolve/genotypes/genotype3.py`
**Missing Classes:** `Orie3DSym`, `Orie3D`

### 2. Morphology Representation Module
**File:** `plot_best_individual_data.py:13`
```python
# from airevolve.inspection_tools.represent_morphology import represent_morphology_3d  # Missing file
```
**Expected Location:** `airevolve/inspection_tools/represent_morphology.py`
**Missing Function:** `represent_morphology_3d`

## Impact

- **`slurm_cluster/main_evaluation.py`**: Cannot instantiate genotype objects without `Orie3DSym` and `Orie3D` classes
- **`plot_best_individual_data.py`**: Cannot generate 3D morphology visualizations without `represent_morphology_3d` function

## Resolution Required

To restore full functionality, these files need to be:
1. Located in the codebase (if they exist elsewhere)
2. Recreated if they were accidentally deleted
3. Or alternative implementations provided
